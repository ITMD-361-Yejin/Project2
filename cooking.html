  <h1>Cooking</h1>
  <p> Hi, you can see simple and delicious foods, which are my favorites!</p>
  <h2>Potato Salad</h2>

  <p>This salad is the easiest one to make. You can pick pretty potatoes and boil them. While cooking them, you can chop spring onions. Peel the boiled potatoes and put the spring onions on them. I know you already have black peppers, salt, and olive oil at your home, so you can add on it as much as you want!</p>
  <h2>Cucumber Marinade</h2>

  <p>This taste good, especially with a sandwich or pasta! I add a video, and this Youtuber I am a big fan of will tell you how to make them kindly. Check it out!
